reviews:
The reviews of the Roku Streaming Stick 4K are overwhelmingly positive, highlighting its quick and easy setup, fast streaming with minimal lag, and user-friendly interface. Many users praised its universal remote that also controls TV power and volume, as well as the voice search and control feature. However, one user pointed out that the interface could be challenging for individuals with cognitive impairments, suggesting larger remotes and fewer options to streamline use. Another reviewer mentioned difficulty in accessing local news stations via an antenna and not liking the changes in dedicated app buttons on the remote. A couple of reviews mentioned the device working well with less than ideal internet speeds, making it an excellent option for cord-cutters in rural areas. Lastly, the compact size of the device was highlighted, though it was noted that additional accessories like a 90Â° adapter or short HDMI cable might be needed for TVs with particular mount types.
