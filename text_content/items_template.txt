Okay lets move on the the next item I need you to give me a summary of this device. this is an Amazon device and the summer needs to be five to seven sentences long. I'm going to give you all the information here:

Okay now I am going to give you the reviews for the item. remember don't say anything about who is saying the reviews like their name, location, date of the review, or anything like that. we just want the contents of the review. remember that has to be five to seven sentences summarizing what the reviews are saying. The summary you give cannot go over 7 sentences.
