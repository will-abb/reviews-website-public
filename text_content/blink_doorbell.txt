reviews:
The All-new Blink Video Doorbell is an economical option for those seeking enhanced security for their homes. It offers admirable video quality and convenient motion detection customization, along with a two-way audio feature that allows easy communication with visitors. The doorbell also provides the option for both hardwired and battery-powered setups. However, to make the most of it, particularly in a battery-powered setup, a Sync Module is necessary for accessing the live-view feature. Also, keep in mind that to enable video recording for future reference, a subscription plan is mandatory. Though this might seem limiting, it is still a practical solution for those simply seeking real-time doorbell notifications. While there is a learning curve and potential extra purchases to maximize its functionality, this device provides a solid foundation for home security.
